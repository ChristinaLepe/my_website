        <h2>Economic trends visualization</h2>
        <p>The <i>Eurostat Ecotrends</i> visualization provides a clear, interactive representation of economic data, 
            including inflation, household income, savings, and investment.</p>
        <p>Inflation in Greece has been relatively high compared to the EU average, showing fluctuating peaks 
            in recent years, reflecting external economic pressures. Household income, though rising steadily, 
            lags behind many EU nations, which is visually evident when compared to other countries. The 
            savings rate in Greece has remained stable but lower than the EU average, suggesting a cautious 
            financial behavior. On the other hand, household investment has seen a positive uptick, signaling 
            an increasing willingness to invest amidst economic recovery.</p>
        <p>By exploring these trends in a visually engaging way, users can easily draw comparisons between Greece 
            and other EU countries, uncovering key patterns and insights, such as the contrast between rising 
            investments and more cautious savings behavior in Greece.</p>
