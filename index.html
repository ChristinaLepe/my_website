                <h2>About me</h2>

                <p>Hi there, welcome to my first website!</p>
                <p>My name is Christina and I am a passionate Translation Technology Specialist.
                    From the very first moment in the field of translation, I decided to be involved
                    in translation technology. I have noticed that using proper translation memories
                    and termbases can make the translation process more efficient, of higher-quality,
                    and accomplished in less time.
                </p>
                <p>I handle every step of managing translation memories and termbases; from creation and organization
                    to updating, editing and ensuring they work seamlessly within CAT tools. In addition, I bring a keen eye
                    for detail to my work as an Editor & Proofreader, ensuring that content is clear, accurate and consistent.
                </p>
                <p>I'm now pursuing an M.Sc. in language technology. </p>
                <p>In my free time, I enjoy working out, practicing martial arts, and traveling.</p>
